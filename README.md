## Quickstart :boom:
To run AWM on WebArena under `webarena/`: 
```bash
python pipeline.py --website "shopping" # choose one from ['shopping', 'shopping_admin', 'reddit', 'gitlab', 'map']
```

To run AWM on Mind2Web under `mind2web/`:
```bash
python pipeline.py --setup "offline" # or "online"
```

## ðŸ§  What is Agent Workflow Memory?
Agent Workflow Memory (ATW) proposes to induce, integrate, and utilize workflows to the agent memory.
A workflow is usually a common sub-routine in solving tasks, with example-specific contexts being abstracted out.

</p>

ATM can operate in both offline and online settings:
- *offline* (left): when additional (e.g., training) examples are available, agents induce workflows from ground-truth annotated examples
- *online* (right): without any auxiliary data, agents induce workflows from past experiences on the fly.

## ðŸ“ˆ How does ATM work?

### On WebArena
We achieve the state-of-the-art result -- 35.6% success rate.

</p>

Check the code in `./webarena/` directory.

### On Mind2Web

We also get the best scores among text-based agents. Particularly, ATM offline effectively generalize across a wide range of tasks, websites, and domains.
